## What is microblogging?

If you stop reading after this page, here's what you need to know:

* Publish short posts and photos to your own web site, at your own personal domain name.
* Make sure your web site has an RSS or JSON feed, and add it to communities like Micro.blog.
* If you want to participate in larger social networks, post to your own site first and then copy the post to Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.
* Massive centralized platforms create problems for society. By posting to your own site, you control your content, distributing it more evenly across the web and minimizing the power of big tech companies.

This might seem like too much work for most people. With many of today's blogging tools, it is. We must work simultaneously on open standards and on making software that follows those standards as easy to use as possible for everyone.

What we don’t want to do is reinvent the wheel with a new social media-like protocol that isn’t rooted in the web and blogs. Others have tried to come up with new systems for microblogging that _don’t use blogs_. But the word “blog” is part of “microblog” for a reason. By using blogs, we get to keep everything that is valuable about blogging. We get to keep existing blog software and IndieWeb-friendly formats.

Blogs are web sites with reverse-chronological posts written by people. The newest posts are always at the top of the web site. They can be news sites, corporate sites, travel sites, photo sites, tech sites. They are often personal, with an individual's voice. Readers want to keep visiting a blog because there's a story, unfolding with each post. The passing of time is a fundamental element to what defines a blog.

This emphasis on time is even more obvious for microblogs. Microblogs are blogs with very short posts. Because short posts are easy to write, there are usually more of them. In the case of a microblogging service like Twitter or Micro.blog, friends' posts are combined together in a timeline.

In an open platform based on indie microblogs, posts in the timeline come from blogs at the author's own domain name. This helps distribute content across the web and reduces the power of the big social networks:

Recent posts are placed at the top of the timeline. Older posts fall to the bottom, and eventually drop off. With this focus on the new, some people consider microblogging ephemeral, but it doesn't have to be.

Indie microblogging is about taking ownership of our microblog post content. It's about reclaiming the definition of what a microblog is from Twitter. Microblogs and social networks are big components of the web — too important to be contained in such a small number of closed, centralized platforms.

An indie microblog is a blog that contains short posts at your own domain name. It can be hosted by multiple providers, but it is conceptually independent of any one platform. It's portable and you control it.
